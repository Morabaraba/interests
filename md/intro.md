But that is not what I'm going to write about.

There is a lot of technology to choose from today to implement any system you desire.
You just need the resources.

Applications, and Data. Creation of both to compliment each other.

Anaylitics, Real Time Aggregation, Visualization is just a couple of things your
company needs to do. Without forgeting about Data Processing and Data Management.

To try and explain the problem we will be working through live MediaWiki Data. 
I would recommend for more fun and a better understanding. 
To start your own project; with data you have easy access to.

We will be using:

- Wikipedia(We will get our data from Wikipedia edits)
- CitusDB(PostgreSQL)
- Python

It has a lot of advantages.

- Mature eco-system
- PostgreSQL also have Support
- Courses and Qualifications
- Support for multiple OS's(GNU/Linux,Microsoft Windows)
- Execelent tooling like pg/SQL, pg/python, pg/v8, hyperloglog, pggis, bigsql, citusdb
- Foreign data wrappers (Cassandra, MySQL, Oracle, Mongo*) http://multicorn.org/
