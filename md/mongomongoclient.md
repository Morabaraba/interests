# MongoDB

BSON and the Mongo C Library makes fdw integration with PostgreSQL a ease. 
On platforms like CentOS(6.5+), Ubuntu, Fedora, OS X.

## Client implementations

So you can use `mongo` from your terminal and write pragmatic javascript. Where
operators get hacked next to a dollar sign.

- $push
- $gte
- $lte
- $project
- $match
- lols

### MongoRock

Cleary the PHP cummunity does not feel the sentiment when you look at mongorock.

### Mongo Client

Not to bad. You going to need a interface if your not a cli whiz.

### psql

A sane interface, yea! With c like speed and a abstraction layer that makes sense.

It's standard library is also vast and well documents. It also have a lot of hip
and fun friends. Python, multicorn, PostGIS, HLL, FDW.
