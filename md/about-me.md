Also before we start I just want to give some background.
o make it easier to understand where I come from; Before we delft through the discussion points.

I'm a technologist with interest in Programming, life time of hacking. 
Unix, Python, JavaScript and PostgreSQL my tools of choice. 
With the recent trend of IoT I also started to focus on 
Erlang and technologies like 
RabbitMQ, CouchDB and CouchApps using PouchDB.

I enjoy and recommend tooling like OS X/Ubuntu/centOS, [c9.io], tmux, vim and git; 

But will hack and learn anything, for fun, frustration and insight.

Currently I'm interested in PostgresSQL, 
and will be using the CitusDB examples as a base to work off.
